Javascript implementation of the Curve25519 and Ed25519 elliptic cryptography functions by Daniel J. Bernstein.

For the API, please consult the generated documentation under doc/ (you can run `make` to generate it).

To run the tests do the following on the console from the project's root directory:

    \$ npm install
    \$ make test

### For the Curve25519 submodule

* [Graydon Hoare](https://github.com/graydon): suggested clamping the private key by default for increased safety and uniformity with other implementations.
* [liliakai](https://github.com/liliakai): spotted an unused argument in some of the functions
* [RyanC](https://github.com/ryancdotorg): removed dependency of a function to the Javascript Math library
* [Guy Kloss](https://github.com/pohutukawa): performance improvements through bit-shift operations, performance and conformance testing, documentation, compatibility with the npm package ecosystem, and more
* [Michele Bini](https://github.com/rev22): originally wrote the Javascript implementation
